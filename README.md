# AnswerBot
AnswerBot is a simple program for AI with text I/O. It provides the AnswerBot class for text I/O, NumberAI for number I/O, and ArrayAI for `ndarray` I/O. It is broken into `ab_models`, `ab_tokenizers`, and `ab`, with the `ab` in all being short for AnswerBot. Development is still in the beta phase and most functionality has not yet been tested.
